Books, courses and web sites on technical topics like machine learning and software engineering.

## Math

* Game Theory - I got interested in this after listening to the NY Times article
["How A.I. Conquered Poker"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/magazine/ai-technology-poker.html) on Audm.
    * [Game Theory with Python](https://www.coursera.org/projects/game-theory-with-python) - Coursera course teaching the basics of game theory using Python.
    * [Game Theory: A Non-Technical Introduction](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486296725.html) by Morton D. Davis - Seems like the best introductory
    book on the subject.

## Statistics

* Bayesian
    * [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) This online and print book
    focuses on using Python to do Bayesian modeling. It's a welcome change from all of the Bayesian books in R, JAGS and other
    non-general purpose languages. The other Bayesian book in Python,
    [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
    didn't impress me so it's nice to have an alternative.
