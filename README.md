## Statistics

* Bayesian
    * :blue_book: [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) This online and print book
    focuses on using Python to do Bayesian modeling. It's a welcome change from all of the Bayesian books in R, JAGS and other
    non-general purpose languages. The other Bayesian book in Python,
    * :blue_book: [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
    didn't impress me so it's nice to have an alternative.

* Causal Inference
    * :blue_book: [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) by Scott Cunningham
    This online and print book is an intuitive and highly-readable introduction to causal inference. It provides
    examples in R and Stata.
    * :blue_book: [Causal Inference: What If](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)

    of Public Health. Brings together information that was previously scattered across many journals
    and disciplines into a single resource.
    * :blue_book: [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/)
    by Nick Huntington-Klein. The Effect is a book intended to introduce students (and non-students)
    to the concepts of research design and causality in the context of observational data. The book
    is written in an intuitive and approachable way and doesn’t overload on technical detail. I heard about this book on the [Practical AI podcast](https://changelog.com/practicalai/220).
