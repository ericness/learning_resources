# learning_resources
Books, courses and web sites on technical topics like machine learning and software engineering.

## Math

* Game Theory - I got interested in this after listening to the NY Times article
["How A.I. Conquered Poker"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/magazine/ai-technology-poker.html) on Audm.
    * [Game Theory with Python](https://www.coursera.org/projects/game-theory-with-python) - Coursera course teaching the basics of game theory using Python.
    * [Game Theory: A Non-Technical Introduction](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486296725.html) by Morton D. Davis - Seems like the best introductory
    book on the subject.

## Statistics

* Bayesian
    * [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) This online and print book
    focuses on using Python to do Bayesian modeling. It's a welcome change from all of the Bayesian books in R, JAGS and other
    non-general purpose languages. The other Bayesian book in Python,
    [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
    didn't impress me so it's nice to have an alternative.

## Machine Learning

* Introductory
    * [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
    The foundational book for machine learning. There is a second edition out that includes deep learning.

* Deep Learning
    * [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew W. Trask
    Plain English explanations of the fundamentals of how neural networks work.

    * [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) Courses for anyone to learn how to use neural networks. The courses can
    be used even if you haven't done anything with ML before.

    * [Neural Networks explainer videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
    from 3Brown1Blue. These videos give an intuitive understanding of how neural networks work.

## Software Engineering

* Software Architecture
    * [Software Architecture: The Hard Parts](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/)
    This looks like a good book. "Architecture veterans and practicing consultants Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage,
    and Zhamak Dehghani discuss strategies for choosing an appropriate architecture."

* Data Structures and Algorithms
    * [LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)
    Filterable list of LeetCode problems to practice different data structures and algorithms patterns.

* Legacy Systems
    * [Kill It with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire) by Marianne Bellotti
    This book is recommended by the hosts of the Staff Eng podcast. It discusses how to smartly refactor legacy systems
    without giving in to the knee-jerk reaction to rebuild from scratch.

## Writing

* From [The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/)
    * [The Writing Well Handbook](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) by Julian Shapiro.
    An e-book for writing nonfiction blogs and books.
    * [Technical Writing Courses by Google](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)
    A collection of courses and learning resources to improve writing technical documentation.
    * [The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)
    An hour and a half video from Leadership Lab. One of the best talks about technical writing.
    * [On Writing Well](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/on-writing-well-william-zinsser?variant=32118081159202) by Willian Zinsser.
    The classic guide to writing nonfiction. The book that helped me write more concisely.

## Leadership

* Technical Leadership
    * [Staff Eng Podcast](https://podcast.staffeng.com/)
    Interviews with Staff-plus engineers from a variety of big tech companies. Sadly, this podcast
    is no longer being produced.

* Management
    * [High Output Management](https://penguinrandomhousehighereducation.com/book/?isbn=9780679762881)
    This book is recommended by one of the hosts of the Staff Eng podcast. It contains a section
    about "Know How Managers" who are more technical leaders than people managers.
